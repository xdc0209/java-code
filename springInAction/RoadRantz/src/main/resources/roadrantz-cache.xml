  This XML file defines beans for caching, as depicted in section 5.7.
  
  Note that although these caching beans seem to work at runtime, you
  may see some errors in the XML in your editor...if your editor is
  XML/XSD-savvy. That's because the Spring Modules XSD files are not
  actually located at http://www.springmodules.org, as they claim to be.
  
  This is a known issue and has been entered into the Spring Modules
  issue tracking system at http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/MOD-329.
