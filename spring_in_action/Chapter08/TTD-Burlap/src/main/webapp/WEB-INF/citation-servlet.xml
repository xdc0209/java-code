  <!-- 
    Exports the citationService bean as a Burlap service.
    
    From section 8.3.2, page 322
    
    Notice, that I'm using the short-hand
    value attribute here, while the book shows the long-hand <value>
    element. I had intended for the book to use the short-hand form, as
    shown below, but didn't catch this until the book was already typeset
    and it was too late to change.
