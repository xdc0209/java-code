Embedding Jetty

Jetty has a slogan, "Don't deploy your application in Jetty, deploy Jetty in your application!" 
What this means is that as an alternative to bundling your application as a standard WAR to be 
deployed in Jetty, Jetty is designed to be a software component that can be instantiated and 
used in a Java program just like any POJO. Put another way, running Jetty in embedded mode means 
putting an HTTP module into your application, rather than putting your application into an HTTP server.

This tutorial takes you step-by-step from the simplest Jetty server instantiation to running 
multiple web applications with standards-based deployment descriptors. The source for most of 
these examples is part of the standard Jetty project.

To embed a Jetty server the following steps are typical and are illustrated by the examples in this tutorial:

Create a Server instance.
Add/Configure Connectors.
Add/Configure Handlers and/or Contexts and/or Servlets.
Start the Server.
Wait on the server or do something else with your thread.
